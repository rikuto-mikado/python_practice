# ToDo App
A Python ToDo list app for learning coding and Git. A step toward full stack development.

## How to Run
🐈Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rikuto-mikado/todo-app.git
```

📂Navigate to the folder:
```sh
cd python-todo-app
```

▶️Run the script:
```sh
python todo.py
```

## Features
- Add tasks with user input.
- View the list of tasks.
- Delete tasks by name.
- Quit the app when done.

## What I Learned
- Python list operations (`append`, `remove`).
- User input handling with `input()`.
- Conditional logic (`if/elif`) and loops (`while`).
- Improved Git workflow for projects.

## Future Ideas
- Add file saving to persist tasks.
