# ToDo App
A Python ToDo list app for learning coding and Git. A step toward full stack development.

## Features
- Add tasks with user input.
- View the list of tasks.
- Delete tasks by name.
- Quit the app when done.

## What I Learned
- Python list operations (`append`, `remove`).
- User input handling with `input()`.
- Conditional logic (`if/elif`) and loops (`while`).
- Improved Git workflow for projects.
