# Treasure Hunt Game  
A simple Python game where players select a box (0-4) to find the hidden treasure. The boxes are shuffled randomly each round, and the game checks if the player found the treasure.

## How to Run  
🐈Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rikuto-mikado/treasure-box-game.git
```

📁Navigate to the folder:
```sh
cd treasure-box-game
```

▶️Run the script:
```sh
python treasure_game.py
```

## Features  
- Randomly shuffled treasure location.  
- Players select a box (0-4) to find the treasure.  
- Simple text-based gameplay.  

## What I Learned  
- Python list operations (`shuffle`, `indexing`).  
- Handling user input with `input()`.  
- Conditional logic (`if/else`).  
- Improved Git workflow for projects.  

## Future Ideas  
- Add multiple guessing chances.  
- Implement a graphical interface (Tkinter/Pygame).  
- Introduce a scoring and leaderboard system.
